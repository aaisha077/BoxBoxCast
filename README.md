# BoxBoxCast
BoxBoxCast is a full-stack Formula 1 weather prediction and car performance analysis website. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and predicts car performance metrics such as grip, downforce, engine power, and lap time based on dynamic conditions. The backend, built with FastAPI, exposes RESTful APIs, while the React.js frontend provides an interactive UI. The project integrates weather-based strategies like DRS and tire recommendations for an enhanced Formula 1 experience.
