# BoxBoxCast
BoxBoxCast is a full-stack Formula 1 weather prediction and car performance analysis app. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and predicts car performance metrics such as grip, downforce, engine power, and lap time based on dynamic conditions. The backend, built with FastAPI, exposes RESTful APIs and securely stores query logs in MongoDB Atlas. The React.js frontend provides an interactive UI, seamlessly integrated with the CORS-enabled backend. The project also addresses common challenges such as SSL certificate handling, ObjectId serialization, and cloud database visibility.
